# Game Engine Details

## Folliage
Folliage and other effects such as wind and floating dandelion seeds are simulated using 2D sprites, such sprites have a fixed point where they rotate around in all axis always following the player. This gives an easy and cheap effect to use in trees and bushes.

## Water Reflection
Having the Wii as one of the console targets meant having reduced graphical effects, developers opted to simply mirror some models vertically and put them under the water to mimic light reflection.

## Cutscenes and early character unlock
In Mini Ninjas you unlock characters by destroyed the cage that they're locked on. During in-game cutscenes if you lock the loading of one of the game's vector axis this cage can break and lead you to unlocking said character earlier than intended.
